## User Retention Exploration

Modeling:
Please use python for answering this question:<br>
In order to improve user retention and lower churn, the growth team at Robinhood is interested in understanding why and which users withdraw money from their Robinhood account.<br>
A user is considered churned when their equity value falls below $100 for a period of 28 consecutive calender days or longer.<br>

Using the datasets given answer the following questions:<br>
a) What percentage of users have churned in the data provided?<br>
b) Build a classifier (rules like if then etc in python) using "training data" that given a user with their features assigns a churn probability for every user and predicts which users will churn.<br>
How well does your classifier perform on the "test data"? Your metric is accuracy, accuracy means (number of correct predictions/number of total predictions)<br>
Based on the classifier (model you built) classify each user in the dataset as churned or not churned.<br>


Datasets: features_data, equity_value_data
